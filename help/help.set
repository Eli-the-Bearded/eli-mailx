Sets a variable or with no parameters lists variables set. While this will
only set or show variables within mail, other usages of variables will also
check the environment. Can set multiple variables at once either as booleans
or with values. Values can contain ~ or $ENVIRONMENT references which will be
expanded if used as a filename (eg for -F on the command line). Backticks can
be used to set a value based on the output of a program run. See "echo".
